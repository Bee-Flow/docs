# Privacy & data flow

When you act on a Nextcloud item, the connector sends the item to the Bee Flow service over TLS. This page is the authoritative description of what's sent, when, and what is **never** sent.

## Always sent (on first install + on every login)

- Your Nextcloud user ID, email, display name
- Group memberships (used to identify your tenant and apply group-based permissions)
- The NC instance ID and version (used by the SaaS to detect spoofing)

## Sent on demand (per user action)

The contents of items you explicitly point the assistant at — and only those items, only at the moment of fetching:

| When you say… | What's sent |
|---------------|-------------|
| "Summarise this file" | The file's contents (not the rest of the folder) |
| "Reply to this email" | The email body + thread headers |
| "Find Q3 reports" | The matching file metadata (paths, sizes, modified dates), not their contents |
| "Create a calendar event for…" | The event description you typed |
| "Search Talk for the discussion about…" | The matching message snippets |

If the assistant chooses to fetch a file's body to answer a search-style query, you'll see a `tool_call` event in the conversation showing the path. Open it to inspect.

## Never sent

- Bulk file/mail/calendar/contacts contents
- Items in folders you didn't reference
- Items belonging to other users
- NC admin secrets, system config, or audit logs
- Browser cookies, session tokens, or device fingerprints

The connector forwards individual requests; nothing is copied, mirrored or indexed by default.

## Detailed by integration

| Integration | What's sent on demand | Endpoints used |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Files | File contents (binary or text), folder listings, share metadata | WebDAV `PROPFIND` / `GET` / `PUT` |
| Mail | Message body + headers, draft contents you create | `/index.php/apps/mail/api/...` |
| Calendar | Event details (title, time, attendees, body) | CalDAV `REPORT` / `PUT` |
| Contacts | Contact card fields (name, email, phone) | CardDAV |
| Deck | Card title, description, comments, labels | `/index.php/apps/deck/api/v1.0/...` |
| Talk | Message text, room metadata | `/ocs/v2.php/apps/spreed/api/v4/...` |
| Notes | Note body, tags | `/index.php/apps/notes/api/v1/notes` |
| Tasks | VTODO objects (title, due date, completed flag) | CalDAV |
| Activity | Read-only activity feed entries | `/ocs/v2.php/apps/activity/api/v2/activity` |
| Notifications | Notification IDs you reference, dismissed | `/ocs/v2.php/apps/notifications/api/v2/notifications` |
| User Status | Your status text + emoji | `/ocs/v2.php/apps/user_status/api/v1/user_status` |

Every request is signed with the tenant-key HMAC and bound to your NC user ID — see [Architecture](architecture.md).

## Inbound webhooks (NC → connector → SaaS)

NC fires events to the connector. Five events are subscribed:

| NC event | Forwarded to SaaS as |
|----------|----------------------|
| `UserCreatedEvent` | `user.created` |
| `UserDeletedEvent` | `user.deleted` |
| `UserChangedEvent` | `user.updated` |
| `Group\UserAddedEvent` | `group.member_added` |
| `Group\UserRemovedEvent` | `group.member_removed` |

The forwarded payload contains the affected user ID and (for group events) the group ID. Names, emails, and group lists are pulled fresh from NC by the SaaS via the HMAC `/nc/*` proxy when needed — they're not pushed in the event payload.

## Encryption in transit

| Hop | Crypto |
|-----|--------|
| Browser ↔ Nextcloud | Your existing NC TLS configuration |
| Nextcloud ↔ Connector | AppAPI signed proxy (HTTP inside the cluster — relies on cluster network) |
| Connector ↔ Bee Flow service | TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS to `server.beeflow.ai` or your self-hosted server) |
| Bee Flow service ↔ NC (callback) | TLS 1.2+ + HMAC signature |

For self-hosters: you choose your own TLS termination on the Bee Flow service. Caddy / Nginx / Traefik examples in [Self-hosting → Docker Compose](../self-hosting/docker-compose.md).

## Privacy Shield (in-tenant filter)

Before any prompt leaves the connector, the **[Privacy Shield](../features/privacy-shield.md)** scans for sensitive data and replaces matches with placeholders. The model only ever sees the placeholders. The original values are restored in the reply, only on your screen.

Default detection covers email addresses, phone numbers, IBANs, BSNs (NL), credit-card numbers, IP addresses and credentialed URLs. Strict mode adds person names, dates of birth, addresses, organisation names, passport / ID numbers. See the full category list on the Privacy Shield page.

## Retention

| Layer | Retention |
|-------|-----------|
| Connector RAM | Per-request only — no on-disk caching of fetched items |
| Connector tenant-key cache | `${APP_PERSISTENT_STORAGE}/tenant-key.json`, mode `0600`. Persists across restarts. Contains: `tenantKey`, `organizationId`, `organizationName`, `cachedAt`. |
| Bee Flow service (chat history) | As long as the conversation exists (deletable by the user) |
| Bee Flow service (raw file bodies) | Held only for the duration of the LLM turn unless explicitly indexed into a Knowledge Base |
| Audit log | 90 days by default; configurable per-org (Enterprise+) |

## How to inspect what's leaving

| Need to verify | Where to look |
|----------------|----------------|
| Per-call NC API access | `tail -f data/nextcloud.log \| grep bee_flow` |
| Per-call connector activity | `docker logs nc_app_bee_flow --tail 200 -f` |
| Per-tool-call provenance in chat | Inline tool-call rows in the conversation — click to expand request/response |
| Per-org audit | **Admin → Audit & compliance** (Enterprise+) |
