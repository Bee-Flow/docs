# Run locally with a local Nextcloud

This page walks you through running the Bee Flow connector on your laptop, against a local Nextcloud, **without** publishing anything to the Nextcloud App Store. Useful for:

- Testing connector changes you haven't released yet
- Verifying an end-to-end install on your machine before submitting to the App Store
- Demoing Bee Flow on an air-gapped laptop

Two paths, pick one:

- **Fast (recommended)** — run the [`local-sandbox.sh`](https://github.com/Bee-Flow/connector/blob/main/scripts/local-sandbox.sh) helper. One command does the whole setup.
- **Manual** — every step, so you can swap in your own pieces.

!!! tip "Working in the Bee Flow monorepo"
    If you're working in the private Bee Flow monorepo (not the public connector clone), the same script is wrapped at `scripts/run-local-nc.sh` for convenience:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/run-local-nc.sh up        # build + run
    ./scripts/run-local-nc.sh status    # state + heartbeat
    ./scripts/run-local-nc.sh logs      # combined NC + connector tail
    ./scripts/run-local-nc.sh down      # stop
    ./scripts/run-local-nc.sh clean     # nuke everything
    ```

    Both wrappers call the same `local-sandbox.sh` underneath — pick whichever is closer to where you're working.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Docker | recent | `docker info` must work without `sudo` |
| Git | any | for cloning |
| Node.js | 20+ | only needed if you want to run the Bee Flow server / frontend locally |

You don't need a public hostname, OAuth apps, model API keys, or anything paid. The local sandbox uses a dummy tenant key so the connector never reaches out to the production Bee Flow service.

## Path A — fast path (the helper script)

This is what works today; it's how I (the maintainer) test connector changes.

### 1. Clone the connector repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bee-Flow/connector.git
cd connector
```

### 2. Bring the sandbox up

```bash
./scripts/local-sandbox.sh up
```

What it does, in order:

1. **Builds** `bee-flow-connector:dev` from the local `Dockerfile`. The Dockerfile clones [`Bee-Flow/hive`](https://github.com/Bee-Flow/hive) anonymously over HTTPS at build time and bakes the SPA into the image — no SSH key or GitHub token required.
2. **Launches** a `nextcloud:31` container at <http://localhost:8080> with admin/admin.
3. **Installs** AppAPI inside Nextcloud (`occ app:install app_api`).
4. **Registers** a `manual_dev` deployment daemon — uses your host's Docker daemon directly, so HaRP / insecure-registry trust doesn't apply.
5. **Registers** the ExApp via `occ app_api:app:register bee_flow manual_dev --info-xml /tmp/info.xml`.
6. The connector container starts, runs the async `/init`, registers its top-bar entry + embed script, subscribes to NC events.
7. Prints a final URL.

End state: <http://localhost:8080>, log in `admin` / `admin`, click the bee in the top bar.

### 3. Useful subcommands

```bash
./scripts/local-sandbox.sh status   # is it up?
./scripts/local-sandbox.sh logs     # tail connector + NC logs
./scripts/local-sandbox.sh down     # stop containers (keep state)
./scripts/local-sandbox.sh clean    # stop + remove containers + volumes
FORCE=1 ./scripts/local-sandbox.sh up  # force re-register from info.xml
```

### 4. Iterating on connector code

After you change `nextcloud-connector/src/*.js` or `appinfo/info.xml`:

```bash
docker rmi bee-flow-connector:dev          # invalidate the cached image
./scripts/local-sandbox.sh up              # rebuild + re-register
```

The script detects when `info.xml` is newer than the registered row and re-registers automatically — handy when you tweak routes.

### 5. Talking to a local Bee Flow server (optional)

By default the connector points at `http://host.docker.internal:3101` for the Bee Flow service. If you've cloned `Bee-Flow/beeflow` and run it locally on `:3101`, this Just Works™. Otherwise the connector will log "SaaS unreachable" — that's fine; the chat UI can still load, and you can verify NC integration plumbing without a backend.

To point at a different URL:

```bash
API_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:9000 ./scripts/local-sandbox.sh up
```

---

## Path B — manual setup

This is the same flow, expanded so you can swap pieces.

### 1. Clone the three repos

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bee-Flow/connector.git
git clone https://github.com/Bee-Flow/hive.git
git clone https://github.com/Bee-Flow/beeflow.git    # optional, only if you want a real backend
```

### 2. Build the connector image

The Dockerfile clones `Bee-Flow/hive` itself at build time, so you don't need to pre-build the frontend.

```bash
cd connector
docker build -t bee-flow-connector:dev .
```

If you want to use a **local** version of hive (with your changes):

```bash
# Build hive's dist/ first
cd ../hive
npm install
npm run build

# Now build the connector with that dist/ baked in instead of the cloned one
cd ../connector
docker build -t bee-flow-connector:dev \
    --build-arg HIVE_REPO=local \
    --build-context hive=../hive \
    .
```

### 3. Run a local Nextcloud

```bash
docker run -d --name bee-flow-nc-sandbox \
    -p 8080:80 \
    --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    nextcloud:31
```

Wait ~10 s for Apache, then:

```bash
docker exec -u www-data bee-flow-nc-sandbox php occ \
    maintenance:install \
    --database=sqlite \
    --admin-user=admin \
    --admin-pass=admin

docker exec -u www-data bee-flow-nc-sandbox php occ \
    config:system:set trusted_domains 1 --value=host.docker.internal
```

### 4. Install AppAPI

```bash
docker exec -u www-data bee-flow-nc-sandbox php occ app:install app_api
```

### 5. Register a `manual-install` deployment daemon

This daemon uses your host's Docker daemon directly — no HaRP, no insecure-registry trust dance.

```bash
docker exec -u www-data bee-flow-nc-sandbox php occ \
    app_api:daemon:register \
    manual_dev \
    "Manual Local" \
    manual-install \
    http \
    host.docker.internal \
    "http://host.docker.internal:8080"
```

### 6. Register the ExApp

The image is `bee-flow-connector:dev` on your host; the daemon will find it via the host Docker socket.

```bash
docker cp connector/appinfo/info.xml bee-flow-nc-sandbox:/tmp/info.xml

docker exec -u www-data bee-flow-nc-sandbox php occ \
    app_api:app:register \
    bee_flow \
    manual_dev \
    --info-xml /tmp/info.xml \
    --env "BEEFLOW_TENANT_KEY=dev-tenant-key" \
    --env "BEEFLOW_API_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3101"
```

`BEEFLOW_TENANT_KEY=dev-tenant-key` skips the bootstrap-against-SaaS step — the connector starts with the dummy key.

### 7. Verify

```bash
# Heartbeat from NC's perspective
docker exec -u www-data bee-flow-nc-sandbox php occ app_api:app:heartbeat bee_flow
# → {"status":"ok"}

# Connector logs
docker logs nc_app_bee_flow --tail 50
# → [Init] Background setup complete

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8080
```

Log in as `admin` / `admin`, click the bee icon in the top bar. The Bee Flow SPA should render.

---

## What you can verify locally

| Verification | How |
|--------------|-----|
| AppAPI signature is honoured | Try `curl -i http://localhost:23000/init` (no auth) — expect 401. |
| HMAC `/nc/*` proxy works | From a separate shell, sign a request with `dev-tenant-key` and POST to the connector's `/nc/ocs/v2.php/cloud/users` — expect a list. |
| Async `/init` is fast | `time docker exec -u www-data bee-flow-nc-sandbox php occ app_api:app:enable bee_flow` — should return in <1 s. |
| Top-bar entry registers | Reload NC; bee icon visible. |
| Embed script registers | Click the bee; SPA loads in the iframe. |
| Event subscriptions work | Create a new NC user (`occ user:add`); see `[Webhook] user.created` in connector logs. |
| Privacy-only mode | Without `BEEFLOW_API_BASE_URL` reachable, the SPA's chat panel will show "Backend unreachable" but the install / NC plumbing still verifies. |

---

## Common issues

### Image not found / pull errors

The `manual-install` daemon looks up images via the host's Docker daemon. If you see "image not found" make sure:

```bash
docker images | grep bee-flow-connector
```

…actually shows your image. If not, rebuild.

### Heartbeat times out

Make sure NC can reach the connector container:

```bash
# From inside the NC container:
docker exec bee-flow-nc-sandbox curl -i http://host.docker.internal:23000/heartbeat
```

If that hangs, your Docker network setup doesn't have `host-gateway` mapping. The `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` flag in the run command is required on Linux; macOS / Windows have it built-in.

### Stuck "Setup in progress" forever

The SPA polls `/api/...` against the configured `BEEFLOW_API_BASE_URL`. With the default `http://host.docker.internal:3101` and no Bee Flow server running, it'll never resolve.

Fix: either run the Bee Flow server locally on `:3101`, or override:

```bash
docker exec -u www-data bee-flow-nc-sandbox php occ \
    app_api:app:setenv bee_flow BEEFLOW_API_BASE_URL https://api.beeflow.ai
```

…and restart the connector container.

### Wiped sandbox after testing

```bash
./scripts/local-sandbox.sh clean
```

…or, manually:

```bash
docker stop nc_app_bee_flow bee-flow-nc-sandbox
docker rm   nc_app_bee_flow bee-flow-nc-sandbox
docker rmi  bee-flow-connector:dev
```

---

## Pointing at a real Bee Flow server

Once you have the local install working, swap the dummy tenant key for the bootstrap flow against a real Bee Flow service:

```bash
# Remove the dummy key, switch to "auto"
docker exec -u www-data bee-flow-nc-sandbox php occ \
    app_api:app:setenv bee_flow BEEFLOW_TENANT_KEY auto

# Point at api.beeflow.ai (or your self-hosted server)
docker exec -u www-data bee-flow-nc-sandbox php occ \
    app_api:app:setenv bee_flow BEEFLOW_API_BASE_URL https://api.beeflow.ai

docker restart nc_app_bee_flow
```

The connector now bootstraps a real tenant key against the SaaS on next start. Watch the logs:

```bash
docker logs nc_app_bee_flow -f | grep -i bootstrap
```

## Where to next

- [Connector → Architecture](../connector/architecture.md) — what's actually happening during `/init` + bootstrap.
- [Connector → Troubleshooting](../connector/troubleshooting.md) — broader error matrix.
- [Self-hosting → Docker Compose](../self-hosting/docker-compose.md) — run the Bee Flow server too, instead of pointing at the SaaS.
