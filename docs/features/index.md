# Features

Bee Flow ships a layered feature set. Some are free at the Community tier; others are gated behind a licence key. See [Tiers](../getting-started/tiers.md) for the full matrix.

## By feature

<div className="bf-grid">

-    [Chat & agents](chat.md)

    **Community+** — Conversational UI on top of every integration. Agents are reusable, named personas with their own tool sets. 10 system starter agents seeded out of the box.

-    [Knowledge bases](knowledge.md)

    **Community+** local · **Pro+** vector — Drop documents in, ask questions across them. Local KB at Community; vector / hybrid / reranked KBs at Pro.

-    [Automations](automations.md)

    **Pro+** — Trigger-based workflows. When an email tagged urgent arrives, summarise and post in Talk. Cron / webhook / NC event / manual triggers.

-    [Privacy shield](privacy-shield.md)

    **Community+** — Detect and redact emails, phone numbers, IBANs, BSNs, credit-card numbers and 14 other categories before prompts reach the model.

-    [DLP & guardrails](dlp.md)

    **Enterprise+** — Stricter org-level policy: block prompts, log policy hits, audit-log export. Azure Content Safety for moderation.

-    [Voice](voice.md)

    **Pro+** — Full-duplex voice calls with the assistant. Voxtral STT/TTS, energy-VAD, barge-in.

## How tier gating works

Premium features are blocked at two layers:

1. **UI** — gated nav entries are hidden at lower tiers (`<RequireTier>` wrapper).
2. **API** — the `requireLicenseFeature()` middleware on the server returns 403 if the feature isn't allowed for the org's tier.

If you reach a 403, your tier doesn't include that feature. Upgrade or contact [tomkooy@beeflow.nl](mailto:tomkooy@beeflow.nl). Source of truth: [`server/license/tiers.js`](https://github.com/Bee-Flow/beeflow/blob/main/license/tiers.js).
