# Applying a licence key

After purchase, you receive a JWT in your inbox. To apply it:

## In the UI

1. Open Bee Flow as an organisation admin.
2. Go to **Settings → Organisation → Licence & usage**.
3. Paste the JWT into the **Licence key** field and click **Apply**.

The server verifies the signature against the bundled public key (`license/bundled-public-key.pem`) and updates the active tier immediately. Premium features become available without a restart.

## Via env var (self-hosted)

Set `BEEFLOW_LICENSE_KEY` and restart the server. Useful for IaC / GitOps deploys where you don't want to paste keys through a UI.

```bash
echo 'BEEFLOW_LICENSE_KEY=eyJhbG...' >> .env
docker compose up -d beeflow-server
```

The env var takes precedence over a key applied via UI, so removing it falls back to whatever was last entered in the UI (or Community tier if neither is set).

## Verifying the active tier

```bash
curl https://beeflow.example.com/api/license/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_jwt>"
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "tier": "pro",
  "expiresAt": "2027-05-09T00:00:00Z",
  "features": [
    "automations",
    "webpages",
    "meeting_notes",
    "skills",
    "ticket_assistant",
    "voice"
  ],
  "limits": {
    "users": 25,
    "agents": 20,
    "messages": 50000,
    "knowledgeBases": 100
  },
  "tenantId": "org_abc",
  "issuedAt": "2026-05-09T00:00:00Z",
  "lastVerifiedAt": "2026-05-09T12:34:56Z"
}
```

`lastVerifiedAt` is updated when the server polls the licence-server for revocation (`BEEFLOW_LICENSE_REFRESH_URL`, default every 24 h).

## JWT structure

The licence is a standard JWT signed with the Bee Flow ECDSA P-256 private key. Header / claims:

```json
{
  "alg": "ES256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
.
{
  "iss": "license.beeflow.ai",
  "sub": "org_abc",
  "tenantId": "org_abc",
  "tier": "pro",
  "limits": { "users": 25, "agents": 20, "messages": 50000 },
  "features": ["automations", "..."],
  "iat": 1715212800,
  "exp": 1746748800
}
```

Verification logic lives in [`server/license/verify.js`](https://github.com/Bee-Flow/beeflow/blob/main/license/verify.js).

## Rotating

Paste a new key at any time — it overwrites the old one. Two situations:

- **Renewal** — same tier, new `exp`. Replace and you're done.
- **Upgrade** (Pro → Enterprise) — premium features that were 403 immediately become reachable. Routes that were UI-hidden appear in the nav.

## Removing

Clear the field and click **Apply**. The org reverts to the Community tier. Premium features become unavailable but **all data is preserved** — automations stop firing, but the definitions stay; vector KBs stay indexed but only local search is available; DLP audit log keeps its existing rows.

Re-applying a valid key restores everything.

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Invalid signature` | Key was tampered with, or you pasted a key for a different deployment. | Verify the key matches what you received. |
| `License expired` | `exp` is in the past. | Renew at <https://beeflow.ai/pricing> or contact <tomkooy@beeflow.nl>. |
| `Public key not found` | `BEEFLOW_LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` set incorrectly. | Unset, or point at `license/bundled-public-key.pem`. |
| `Tier limit exceeded` (after applying) | The new tier is **lower** than what you had — usage already exceeds the new limits. | Either upgrade, or trim usage (delete agents, archive automations) until under the limit. |
| `License revoked` | The licence-server marked your key as revoked. | Contact <tomkooy@beeflow.nl>. |
| `Refresh failed (network)` | `BEEFLOW_LICENSE_REFRESH_URL` unreachable. | Non-fatal — the key stays valid until `exp`. Whitelist the licence host. |

## Air-gapped deployments

For air-gapped self-hosters:

```bash
# Disable the periodic refresh check
echo 'BEEFLOW_LICENSE_REFRESH_URL=' >> .env

# Or: serve a stub from your own host
# echo 'BEEFLOW_LICENSE_REFRESH_URL=https://my-licence-stub.internal/refresh' >> .env
```

The licence is valid offline through `exp`. To rotate, ship a new JWT.
