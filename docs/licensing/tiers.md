# Tiers

:::warning[Subject to change]

Tier limits, pricing and feature gates on this page are still being tuned
over the coming weeks. Treat the numbers below as indicative — we'll update
this page as the structure settles.

:::

Bee Flow ships in three tiers. **Community** is the default state of a fresh
install — no licence key, no caps. Community covers the free self-hosted
core: chat with agents, knowledge bases, the Nextcloud connector (including
**signing in to Bee Flow from the Nextcloud App Store app** via Nextcloud
OAuth), multi-user with groups, themes, the skills marketplace, and **all
built-in integrations** (Google, Microsoft, AI image/music/video generation,
third-party connectors and the Nextcloud module family).

Community also ships the **no-code [automation builder](../features/automations.md)
and scheduled agent routines** — for free. Building automations is free; what
stays paid is **collaboration**: sharing an automation or routine across your
team (`automation_sharing`) and **Projects** (team workspaces). On Community,
automations and routines are private to the person who creates them — the
Community tier doesn't include sharing them across a team, so only the creator
can access them.

**Enterprise** does **not** add the built-in integrations or the automation
builder themselves — those are free in Community. What Enterprise adds is the
**collaboration** layer on top (sharing automations/routines across a team,
**Projects** team workspaces), the **MCP Server Marketplace** *(an Enterprise
beta — a later implementation; see [Integrations → MCP](../integrations/index.md))*,
**SSO beyond Nextcloud** (Google / Microsoft / SAML — Nextcloud OAuth login stays
Community) together with the rest of the Studio-class capabilities (voice chat,
webpage creation, meeting notes, notebooks, component designer), the
advanced Privacy Shield modes, guardrail DLP, the compliance hub (GDPR + AI
Act) — **the remaining beta features also require Enterprise** (the automation
builder + agent routines are the exception: they are GA features free in
Community). Enterprise also unlocks the paid **admin-dashboard surfaces** (Agents,
Monitoring, Compliance, Support, Appearance/branding, Product Website) — see
[Admin dashboard by tier](#admin-dashboard-by-tier) below. **Full** layers
white-label branding and sub-licence issuance on top for resellers.

## Limits

The Community tier is uncapped. Paid tiers do not introduce smaller limits;
they add capability rather than headroom.

| Limit (`tiers.js` key) | Community | Enterprise | Full |
|-------|:---------:|:----------:|:----:|
| Users (`max_users`) | unl. | unl. | unl. |
| Agents (`max_agents`) | unl. | unl. | unl. |
| Messages / month (`max_messages_per_month`) | unl. | unl. | unl. |
| Knowledge-base sources (`max_kb_sources`) | unl. | unl. | unl. |

Conventions used elsewhere in the product (cron intervals, KB document size
cap, audit retention) are policy defaults rather than hard-coded limits and
may move at any time.

Legend: ✅ available · — not available

The **MCP Server Marketplace** is a Community feature but a *later
implementation* — treat it as on the roadmap rather than fully stabilised. It
lives in the (Community-visible) **Admin → Integrations** tab.

## Admin dashboard by tier

Admin dashboard tabs are gated by the install's **resolved tier**. The gate
reads the real tier (there is no super-admin elevation in
`LicenseContext.hasTier`), so a Community install shows the limited set even to
its own operator. Tabs above the tier are **hidden** from the tab bar — not
shown locked.

| Admin tab | Community | Enterprise+ |
|-----------|:---------:|:-----------:|
| AI Config | ✅ | ✅ |
| Security (incl. user & group management) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Integrations (Global Defaults · OAuth services) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Server licence | ✅ | ✅ |
| Languages | ✅ | ✅ |
| Agents | — | ✅ |
| Monitoring (Usage & Monitoring) | — | ✅ |
| Compliance | — | ✅ |
| Support (Bee Flow inbox) | — | ✅ |
| Appearance (branding studio) | — | ✅ |
| Product Website | — | ✅ |

**Subscriptions** is a Bee Flow Cloud operator surface — it's cloud-only and
never appears on a self-hosted install, so it carries no tier flag.

Community keeps the **Integrations** tab on purpose: an operator needs it to
wire up OAuth credentials and (later) install MCP servers — without it the free
built-in integrations couldn't be configured. The gate lives in
[`agent-hub/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`](https://github.com/Bee-Flow/beeflow/blob/main/agent-hub/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx)
(`minTier` per tab, enforced in `checkTabAccess`).

## Feature-flag names

The server enforces premium features via `requireLicenseFeature(name)`. Names
you'll see in 403 responses:

| Flag | Min tier | Routes / surfaces |
|------|:--------:|--------------------|
| `voice_chat` | Enterprise | Realtime voice chat (Voxtral STT/TTS), `/ai/voice` |
| `webpages` | Enterprise | AI-built static webpages, `/api/webpages` |
| `automations` | Community | No-code automation builder, `/api/automation*`. Personal use is free; a GA beta that's Community-exempt from the beta tier floor |
| `agent_routines` | Community | Scheduled agent runs (Studio → Routines), `/api/ai-tasks`. Free personal use; GA beta, Community |
| `automation_sharing` | Enterprise | Sharing automations/routines across a team. **Reserve gate** — pins the paid collaboration boundary for the free builder; no route consumes it yet |
| `meeting_notes` | Enterprise | Transcription + summarisation, `/api/transcriptions`, `/api/meet-bot` |
| `component_designer` | Enterprise | Custom UI components, `/components` |
| `notebooks` | Enterprise | Per-user research notebooks, `/api/notebooks` |
| `projects` | Enterprise | Projects / team workspaces (sidebar accordion + `/api/projects`) |
| `pii_tokenize` | Enterprise | Privacy Shield "Tokenize & round-trip" PII action; community PUT clamps `piiDetectionAction` to `block` server-side |
| `web_search_guard` | Enterprise | Privacy Shield Web Search Guard toggle + category filter; community PUT force-disables it server-side |
| `advanced_usage_monitoring` | Enterprise | Usage & Monitoring tabs other than Overview — Safety, Integrations, Feedback, Terminations. Gates `/api/usage/{guardrails,integrations,azure-services}/*`, `/api/feedback`, `/api/terminations` |
| `compliance_hub_gdpr` | Enterprise | `/api/compliance`, guardrail audit log export, DSR flows |
| `compliance_hub_aia` | Enterprise | AI Act compliance hub |
| `sso_saml` | Enterprise | SAML 2.0 IdP config |
| `guardrails_dlp` | Enterprise | DLP rule editor + enforcement |
| `integrations` | Community | All built-in integrations (Google, Microsoft, AI generation, third-party, Nextcloud). **Capability marker, not a route gate** — integration tool usage in chat is ungated by design (`server/core/integrationTools.js` gates only on OAuth/credentials + org/user toggles) |
| `mcp_marketplace` | Community | MCP Server Marketplace (later implementation). Marker — no tier check on MCP install or tool usage |
| `nextcloud_oauth` | Community | Sign-in to Bee Flow from the Nextcloud App Store app + Nextcloud OAuth |
| `custom_themes` | Community | Theme overrides beyond branding basics |
| `white_label` | Full | Branding overrides (logo, colours, domain) |
| `license_issuance` | Full | Sub-licence minting |

Community-tier features (`chat_basic`, `kb_local_small`, `kb_unlimited`,
`nextcloud_basic`, `nextcloud_oauth`, `multi_user`, `skills`, `automations`,
`agent_routines`) are still passed through `requireLicenseFeature` at their mount
sites — the gate is a no-op because the feature lives in `TIER_FEATURES.community`.
The `integrations` flag is a **capability marker** rather than a mounted gate:
built-in integrations are deliberately ungated at runtime, and the flag exists so
the UI/docs can reference it and so the community feature tests
(`server/license/tiers.test.js`, `communityEnforcement.test.js`) fail loudly if
a future change ever tries to move them behind Enterprise. Beta
features (the `BETA_FEATURES` registry) generally require Enterprise or
higher: on a Community install every `requireBetaFeature(...)` call
short-circuits to a 403 with
`{ error: 'feature_locked', reason: 'beta_requires_enterprise', required:
'enterprise', upgrade_url: … }` so the UI can route the user to the right
CTA. **The exception is the free automation builder:** `automations` and
`agent_routines` are GA betas whose licence feature lives in Community, so they
are *exempt* from the beta tier floor and work on a Community install
(`server/core/betaFeatures.js` returns them below the floor). Super-admins bypass
the tier check (same exemption that already exists for licensed-feature gates).

## Limit enforcement

With Community uncapped, no limit currently fires for unlicensed installs.
The enforcement plumbing is still in place so paid tiers (or future custom
plans) can impose caps:

| Limit | Where it fires | What you see |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| Users | `POST /auth/admin/users` and the NC sync job | UI shows "Tier limit reached"; sync skips new users (only fires when a custom plan sets `max_users` > 0) |
| Agents | `POST /api/agents` | UI shows "Tier limit reached" |
| Messages / mo | `POST /api/chat` | 402 Payment Required, `error: "tier_limit"` |
| KB count | `POST /api/knowledge` | 402 |

Counters reset on the first day of each calendar month at 00:00 UTC.

## Picking a tier

| Need | Suggested tier |
|------|----------------|
| Free self-hosted core — chat, KB, agents, skills, **all built-in integrations**, the **no-code automation builder + scheduled agent routines** (personal use), and the Nextcloud connector (incl. signing in from the NC App Store app) | Community |
| Team that wants **collaboration** on top of the free builder (sharing automations/routines across a team, **Projects** team workspaces), the MCP Server Marketplace, the rest of Studio (voice, webpage creation, notebooks, meeting notes, component designer), the advanced Privacy Shield modes (tokenize PII, web-search guard), the paid admin tabs (Agents, Monitoring, Compliance, Support, Appearance, Product Website), the remaining beta features, or compliance (SSO, GDPR/AI-Act) | Enterprise |
| Reseller / private-label deployment | Full |

Custom plans (e.g. capped seats, specific feature sets) are available —
contact [tomkooy@beeflow.nl](mailto:tomkooy@beeflow.nl).

## Legacy Pro tier

Earlier versions of Bee Flow exposed a paid **Pro** tier that gated
automations, voice, meeting notes, knowledge-base expansion and similar
features. That tier has been retired and those features now ship in
**Enterprise**.

For backward compatibility, existing licences carrying `tier: "pro"` —
whether JWT-signed, admin-issued blobs, or Stripe subscription rows — are
still accepted and silently resolved to `enterprise`. Paying Pro
customers therefore retain everything they had and pick up the additional
Enterprise capabilities (compliance hub, SSO, etc.) at no extra step. The
mapping lives in
[`server/license/tiers.js`](https://github.com/Bee-Flow/beeflow/blob/main/license/tiers.js)
as `LEGACY_TIER_ALIAS`.
