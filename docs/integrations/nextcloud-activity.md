# Nextcloud — Activity

The [Activity](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/activity) app surfaces a unified feed of file changes, shares, comments, mentions. Bee Flow reads it (read-only) so the assistant can answer "what changed yesterday?" type questions.

## Read-only

This integration is intentionally read-only. The Activity app doesn't expose write endpoints, and Bee Flow does not synthesise events.
