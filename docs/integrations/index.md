# Integrations

Bee Flow ships connectors for ~30 external services. Each integration exposes one or more **tools** to the agent — a tool is a typed function call the model can issue.

This page is the catalog. Click into each integration for tool lists, OAuth scopes, env vars, and troubleshooting.

## Catalog

## Three-layer access control

Integrations are gated at three layers, in order:

```
1. User-level    — has the user connected the OAuth, or supplied an API key?
2. Org-level     — is the integration enabled in the org's enabledIntegrations list?
3. Group-level   — has any of the user's groups disabled it?
```

The rule for level 3 is **enable wins** — a user gets access if **at least one** of their groups still allows it. If every group the user belongs to disables an integration, the integration is denied for that user.

## Auto-enabled apps

These integrations are implicitly available to every user unless explicitly disabled at the org or group level (no opt-in needed):

```
agent-search, workspace, image-gen, music-gen, video-gen, elevenlabs,
google-maps, linkedin, github, google-contacts, google-keep, outlook,
outlook-readonly, ms-calendar, onedrive, ms-contacts, google-groups,
n8n, nextcloud, nextcloud-calendar, nextcloud-contacts, nextcloud-deck,
nextcloud-notifications, nextcloud-talk, nextcloud-tasks, nextcloud-notes,
nextcloud-activity, nextcloud-status
```

Some of these still require user OAuth (e.g. Google) — they're "auto-enabled" in the sense that the org/group filter doesn't block them; the per-user authorisation gate is separate.

## How to connect a tool to an agent

Three ways:

1. **All tools** (default for new agents) — agent sees every tool the user has access to.
2. **Per-agent allow-list** — in **Studio → Agent designer**, pick exactly the tools this agent can call.
3. **Per-tool denylist** — block specific tools at the agent level. Useful when you want a customer-support agent that *can't* read Files but *can* read Mail.

## How org admins control access

In **Admin → Nextcloud integrations** (and **Admin → Other integrations**) an admin can:

- Toggle integrations on/off org-wide
- Override per-group (disable specific tools for specific groups)
- Lock per-user override settings (so users can't re-enable disabled tools)
