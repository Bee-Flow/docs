## Auth details

The user configures their mail accounts inside the Nextcloud Mail app first. Bee Flow's tools then use AppAPI's signed proxy to call the Mail REST API at `/index.php/apps/mail/api/...`.

The mail account passwords are stored by NC, encrypted at rest. Bee Flow never sees them; it relies on the NC session to act on behalf of the user.

## Privacy Shield

Email bodies and attachments pulled via these tools go through the Privacy Shield before reaching the model. With Strict mode, recipient names and addresses are redacted; the assistant still works in placeholder-space and your screen un-redacts.

## Common errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `No mail accounts configured` | User hasn't added any | They open Nextcloud Mail and add one. |
| `IMAP login failed` | Mail-app auth issue, not Bee Flow | Fix in NC Mail. |
| `Attachment too large` | Body limit | Raise `BEEFLOW_REQUEST_BODY_LIMIT`. |
