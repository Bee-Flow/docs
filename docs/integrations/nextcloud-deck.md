## Endpoints

```
GET    /index.php/apps/deck/api/v1.0/boards
GET    /index.php/apps/deck/api/v1.0/boards/{id}
GET    /index.php/apps/deck/api/v1.0/boards/{id}/stacks/{sid}/cards/{cid}
POST   /index.php/apps/deck/api/v1.0/boards/{id}/stacks/{sid}/cards
PUT    /index.php/apps/deck/api/v1.0/boards/{id}/stacks/{sid}/cards/{cid}
DELETE /index.php/apps/deck/api/v1.0/boards/{id}/stacks/{sid}/cards/{cid}
POST   /ocs/v2.php/apps/deck/api/v1.0/cards/{cid}/comments
```

Deck's own API uses both `/index.php/apps/deck/api/v1.0` and `/ocs/v2.php/apps/deck/api/v1.0` for different endpoints — Bee Flow handles both transparently.

## Use cases

- "Move all cards labelled `bug` from `In Progress` back to `Triage`."
- "Summarise the Engineering board's open cards."
- "Create a card on the Marketing board for next week's release."
- (Automation) "Every Friday 17:00, post a Talk message listing cards completed this week."

## Common errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `403 Forbidden` on board | User isn't a member | Board owner shares with `Edit` access. |
| `Card not found` | Card was archived | Use `nextcloud_deck_list_cards` with `archived=true`. |
